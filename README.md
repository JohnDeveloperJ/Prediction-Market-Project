## Overview
The Prediction Market Project introduces a groundbreaking decentralized application (DApp) designed for users to engage in and establish prediction markets. Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, this DApp provides a transparent, secure, and unbiased environment for an array of predictive events. Whether it's predicting outcomes in sports, financial markets, or any other future events, our platform is tailored to support a diverse spectrum of prediction markets.

## Features
- **Decentralized Predictive Betting**: Engage in betting on various event outcomes in a fully decentralized and trust-free ecosystem.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Utilizes the Ethereum blockchain for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions.
- **Chainlink VRF for Fairness**: Incorporates Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function (VRF) to assure fairness and randomness in outcomes.
- **ERC20 Token Support**: Facilitates betting and transactions using widely-recognized ERC20 tokens.

## Technology Stack
- **Ethereum Blockchain**: Foundation for smart contracts and decentralized trust.
- **Solidity**: Contracts coded in Solidity ^0.8.0, taking advantage of Ethereum's secure and powerful ecosystem.
- **Chainlink VRF**: For trustworthy, immutable random number generation.
- **OpenZeppelin**: Implements OpenZeppelin's secure smart contract frameworks.
- **Hardhat**: Used for setting up the Ethereum development environment and testing.

## Getting Started
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure these tools are installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://npmjs.com/)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/prediction-market.git
   ```
2. **Go to the directory**
   ```shell
   cd prediction-market
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

## Smart Contract Usage
The `PredictionMarket` smart contract facilitates user participation in prediction markets, allowing them to place bets and claim winnings in a decentralized framework. Participants can forecast the outcomes of various events and stake ERC20 tokens on their predictions.

### Key Contract Functions:
- `joinMarket(uint256 _prediction, uint256 _tokensStaked)`: Enables users to enter the market with a prediction and a stake in tokens.
- `closeMarket()`: Shuts the market and triggers a randomness request from Chainlink VRF.
- `claimWinnings()`: Allows users to claim their winnings after the determination of the outcome.
